Cross Site Scripting

Risk:			Medium
Reliability:	Warnning
Decription:		
	Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of injection attack in which a threat actor inserts data, such as a malicious script, into content from trusted websites. The malicious code is then included with dynamic content delivered to a victim's browser. XSS is one of the most common cyber attack types.
Solution:
	For XSS attacks to be successful, an attacker needs to insert and execute malicious content in a webpage. Each variable in a web application needs to be protected. Ensuring that all variables go through validation and are then escaped or sanitized is known as perfect injection resistance. Any variable that does not go through this process is a potential weakness. Frameworks make it easy to ensure variables are correctly validated and escaped or sanitised. However, frameworks aren't perfect and security gaps still exist in popular frameworks like React and Angular. Output Encoding and HTML Sanitization help address those gaps.
